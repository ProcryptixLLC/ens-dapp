# Resolver

**Parameters**

-   `ens`  
-   `address`  
-   `node`  
-   `abi`  

## reverseAddr

reverseAddr looks up the reverse record for the address returned by the resolver's addr()

**Parameters**

-   `callback`  An optional callback, for asynchronous operation.

Returns **any** In synchronous operation, the Resolver for the reverse record.

## abi

abi returns the ABI associated with the name. Automatically looks for an ABI on the
    reverse record if none is found on the name itself.

**Parameters**

-   `callback`  An optional callback, for asynchronous operation.

Returns **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** In synchronous operation, the contract ABI.

## contract

contract returns a web3 contract object. The address is that returned by this resolver's
`addr()`, and the ABI is loaded from this resolver's `ABI()` method, or the ABI on the
reverse record if that's not found. Returns null if no address is specified or no ABI
was found.

**Parameters**

-   `callback`  An optional callback, for asynchronous operation.

Returns **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** In synchronous operation, the contract instance.

# ENS

Provides an easy-to-use interface to the Ethereum Name Service.

Example usage:

    var ENS = require('ethereum-ens');
    var Web3 = require('web3');

    var web3 = new Web3();
    var ens = new ENS(web3);

    var address = ens.resolver('foo.eth').addr();

Throughout this module, the same optionally-asynchronous pattern as web3 is
used: all functions that call web3 take a callback as an optional last
argument; if supplied, the function returns nothing, but instead calls the
callback with (err, result) when the operation completes.

Functions that create transactions also take an optional 'options' argument;
this has the same parameters as web3.

**Parameters**

-   `web3` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** A web3 instance to use to communicate with the blockchain.
-   `address` **address** The address of the ENS registry. Defaults to the public ENS registry if not supplied.

## resolver

resolver returns a resolver object for the specified name, throwing
ENS.NameNotFound if the name does not exist in ENS.
Resolver objects are wrappers around web3 contract objects, with the
first argument - always the node ID in an ENS resolver - automatically
supplied. So, to call the `addr(node)` function on a standard resolver,
you only have to call `addr()`.

**Parameters**

-   `name` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The name to look up.
-   `abi` **list** Optional. The JSON ABI definition to use for the resolver.
           if none is supplied, a default definition implementing `has`, `addr`, `name`,
           `setName` and `setAddr` is supplied.
-   `callback` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Optional. If specified, the function executes
           asynchronously.

Returns **any** The resolver object if callback is not supplied.

## reverse

reverse returns a resolver object for the reverse resolution of the specified address,
throwing ENS.NameNotFound if the reverse record does not exist in ENS.
Resolver objects are wrappers around web3 contract objects, with the
first argument - always the node ID in an ENS resolver - automatically
supplied. So, to call the `addr(node)` function on a standard resolver,
you only have to call `addr()`.

**Parameters**

-   `address` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The address to look up.
-   `abi` **list** Optional. The JSON ABI definition to use for the resolver.
           if none is supplied, a default definition implementing `has`, `addr`, `name`,
           `setName` and `setAddr` is supplied.
-   `callback` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Optional. If specified, the function executes
           asynchronously.

Returns **any** The resolver object if callback is not supplied.

## setResolver

setResolver sets the address of the resolver contract for the specified name.
The calling account must be the owner of the name in order for this call to
succeed.

**Parameters**

-   `name` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The name to update
-   `address` **address** The address of the resolver
-   `options` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** An optional dict of parameters to pass to web3.
-   `callback` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** An optional callback; if specified, the
           function executes asynchronously.
-   `addr`  

Returns **any** The transaction ID if callback is not supplied.

## owner

owner returns the address of the owner of the specified name.

**Parameters**

-   `name` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The name to look up.
-   `callback` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** An optional callback; if specified, the
           function executes asynchronously.

Returns **any** The resolved address if callback is not supplied.

## setOwner

setOwner sets the owner of the specified name. Only the owner may call 
setResolver or setSubnodeOwner. The calling account must be the current
owner of the name in order for this call to succeed.

**Parameters**

-   `name` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The name to update
-   `address` **address** The address of the new owner

-   `callback` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** An optional callback; if specified, the
           function executes asynchronously.
-   `addr`  

Returns **any** The transaction ID if callback is not supplied.

## setSubnodeOwner

setSubnodeOwner sets the owner of the specified name. The calling account
must be the owner of the parent name in order for this call to succeed -
for example, to call setSubnodeOwner on 'foo.bar.eth', the caller must be
the owner of 'bar.eth'.

**Parameters**

-   `name` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The name to update
-   `address` **address** The address of the new owner
-   `options` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** An optional dict of parameters to pass to web3.
-   `callback` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** An optional callback; if specified, the
           function executes asynchronously.
-   `addr`  

Returns **any** The transaction ID if callback is not supplied.

# normalise

**Parameters**
